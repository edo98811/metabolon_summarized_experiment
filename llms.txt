# Introduction

This is a package developed as interface from standard bioinformatics
pipelines to the metabolon software.

It can load metabolon data in a `SummarizedExperiment` object, which is
a common data structure used in bioinformatics for storing
high-throughput assay data along with associated metadata.

Metabolon offers a platform for multiomics analysis. This package also
offers an interface to it by allowing export of data in the required
format. There are functions to export data from a summarized experiment
as “counts” file that can be uploaded to the metabolon platform.

Furthermore, results from different standard bioinfomratics pipelines,
for example differential analysis using `DESeq2` or `limma`, can be
exported in the required format to be uploaded to the metabolon
platform. The results can also be just a data frame with the required
columns. The obrained tables can be directly uploaded to the myMetabolon
platform.

# Installation
